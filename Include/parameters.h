/**
 * @brief A fourth-order IIR-filter to filter the data before
 * processing it. By using this filter, we should (hopefully)
 * eliminate unwanted frequencies.
 *
 * @warning Must have abs(filter) < 1 to prevent overflow
 *
 * @warning The filter is designed with the filterdesigner
 * in MATLAB, using
 *      Fs    = 112500        Sampling frequency
 *      Fc1   = 15000         Lower cut-off frequency
 *      Fc2   = 45000         Upper cut-off frequency
 *
 *      Order = 4             Filter order
 *      Type  = Butterworth   Filter type
 *
 *
 * The filter's transferfunction is given as
 *      H(z) = B(z) * 1 / A(z)
 * where
 *      B(z) = b0 + b1 * z^(-1) + b2 * z^(-2) + b3 * z^(-3) + ...
 *      A(z) = 1 + a1 * z^(-1) + a2 * z^(-2) + a3 * z^(-3) + ...
 *
 * NOTE: Since the function uses a biquad-filter, every filter with order > 2 is
 * split into multiple serial second-order filters, leaving at most one filter
 * with order = 1
 *
 * Example:
 *      4th order filter with the original filter function given as
 *      H(z) = B(z)/A(z) with
 *
 *          B(z) = b0 + b1 * z^(-1) + b2 * z^(-2) + b3 * z^(-3) + b4 * z^(-4)
 *          A(z) = 1 + a1 * z^(-1) + a2 * z^(-2) + a3 * z^(-3) + a4 * z^(-4)
 *
 *      is instead given as H(z) = B_1(z)/A_1(z) * B_2(z)/A_2(z), where
 *
 *          B_1(z) = b10 + b11 * z^(-1) + b12 * z^(-2)
 *          A_1(z) = 1 + a11 * z^(-1) + a12 * z^(-2)
 *
 *      and equivalent for B_2(z) and A_2(z)
 *
 * NOTE: For more information, see
 * https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/DSP/html/group__BiquadCascadeDF1__32x64.html
 *
 * NOTE: The MATLAB-script used to test the filter can be found in the Matlab
 * folder in in the main directory.
 *
 * @param num_stages            Number of second order cascade-filters.
 * Determines the filter order. Order = 2 * num_stages
 *
 * @param state_coefficients    Initial values for x[n-1], x[n-2], ...,
 * x[n-(2*num_stages)] y[n-1], y[n-2], ..., y[n-(2*num_stages)]
 *
 * @param filter_coefficients   Filter coefficients given as {b10, b11, b12,
 * a11, a12 b20, b21, b22, a21, a22, ...}
 *
 * @param IIR_FILTER            A struct describing a biquad DF1 IIR filter
